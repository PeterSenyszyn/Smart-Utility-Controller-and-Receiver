# Smart-Utility-Controller-and-Receiver
A project created exclusively for Flaire LLC

Contains prototype code for what will be a simple smart watch controller, and a modular receiver that can receive inputs based on gestures from the controller. 

This project will not be limited to only changing lamp colors, but will eventually will handle many aspects of the home like 
fan speed, AC controls, etc.
